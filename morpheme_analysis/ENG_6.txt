Trump's medical sparks online 'girther' movement

US presidents regularly undergo physical examinations. It is not remarkable. However, the results of Donald Trump's recent medical check-up have sparked an online conspiracy theory - the girther movement.

According to the official medical report, released by the White House on 16 January, President Trump stands at 75 inches (6ft 3in; 1.9m) and weighs 239lb (17st 1lb; 108kg).

But the girther movement, propelled mainly by critics of the president, posits that Mr Trump is shorter and heavier than the report suggests.

This particular presidential physical has received increased interest after questions were raised over Mr Trump's mental health and supposed unhealthy diet.

Has anyone coined "girther" for those who belive the president weighs more than his doctor reports?

One of the most popular girther tweets claims to show a photograph of Mr Trump's driving licence listing the president as 6ft 2in (74in; 1.88m), an inch shorter than reported by the White House physician.

An image of his driving licence appeared in a 2016 article on news website Politico.

For the record, @realDonaldTrump said he was 74 inches in 2012. Now his doctor says he's 75 inches. And that one inch makes is BMI "overweight" not "obese." I'm a #girther because old men don't GROW an inch!

Others have been sharing photographs of professional athletes with a similar height and weight to the president, pointing out the disparity in their appearance.

However, many have highlighted that muscle is heavier than fat, which may make comparisons unfair.

I'm loving this #girther debate. To be fair to #Trump (not something I would usually say), muscle weighs more than fat, so we can't compare him to an athlete. However, by any measure, Trump is obese. https://twitter.com/AynRandPaulRyan/status/953422600826372096 ¡¦

Others online have questioned the independence of the doctor overseeing the medical examination. Dr Ronny L Jackson is the current Physician to the President and oversaw two of former President Obama's medical examinations.

Dr Jackson said in a press conference that Mr Trump has "incredible genes" and if he had a healthier diet over past 20 years "he might live to be 200".

Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn used the #girther hashtag to offer to donate $100,000 (¡Ì72,470) to charity if the president agreed to be re-weighed by a different doctor.

I will give 100 thousand dollars to Trump's favorite charity if he will step on an accurate scale with an impartial medical professional, okayed by both of us. For real. #Girther #GirtherMovement

While much of the discussion online was sceptical of the claims made in the president's medical report, some defended Mr Trump and slammed the girther movement.

Referring to previous calls for the president to release his tax returns, one twitter user questioned if Mr Trump's critics would ever be satisfied with the evidence produced by the current administration.

The way the left responds to Trump's weight just makes me think that if he DID release his tax returns, the left would call it fake anyway. And I'm no Trump fan. #Girther

Some suggested the girther movement was hypocritical for fat-shaming the president.

Twitter is the sort of place where people who condemn Trump's wisecracks about physical attributes make wisecracks about his physical attributes.

The term girther is an apparent nod to the well-established "birther' movement", made up mainly of right-wing activists who opposed President Obama, with Mr Trump as its most public face.

Birthers questioned the former president's place of birth and his eligibility to hold high office.

It has been widely derided as a racist conspiracy.

The birther theory was pushed hard by Mr Trump, and resulted in Mr Obama releasing his birth certificate to the public in 2011.
